	<center><p> This was my first ever Florida trip with my other family and it was the best one yet! We went in July because we were celebraing 2 birthdays and so we could see the firework on 4th of July. We stayed at a Condo and we were there for a whole week! That is the longest vacation I have ever been on and it was just so much fun with them. </p>

	<center> <p> This was the nigth of Fourth Of July, it was the best show. We found a spot on the beach and we watched the fireworks for about 30 minutes. We started to get scared because it was also suppose to storm that night but it only started to sprinkle a little bit but that didint stop the show! </p>
